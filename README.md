Payment page

This project demonstrates how to create a functional and simple Payment Page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page allows users to input their payment details and simulate a payment process. The project includes form validation, responsive design for various screen sizes, and a simple user interface that provides an easy-to-use payment experience.
Project Overview

This payment page consists two type of payment
-> UPI
-> Credit card

The payment page consists of a form where users can enter necessary payment information, including:

    Card number
    Expiration Date
    CVV/CVC
    Name on Card
    UPI ID
    
Once the user fills out the form, JavaScript ensures that the input is correct by performing validation checks on each field before allowing the form submission. The form also uses CSS for styling, making it visually appealing and mobile-friendly.
Key Features:

    Input Fields:

        Card Number (validates the format of the card number).
        Expiration Date (ensures the date is in the future).
        CVV (ensures the correct length).
        Name on Card (optional field for the user's name).
        UPI ID (ensure the upi id is in mail format)

    Validation Logic: JavaScript functions that validate user input before submission, ensuring the data is correct and formatted properly.

    Responsive Design: The page layout is mobile-friendly, using CSS media queries to ensure it looks good on any screen size.

    Interactive Form: Provides real-time feedback when incorrect information is entered.

    Customizable: You can easily modify the form fields and styles according to your own requirements.

Technologies Used

    HTML: Used to structure the content of the page, including form fields for payment information.

    CSS: For styling the payment page. It makes the form layout clean, modern, and responsive across devices, such as desktop, tablet, and mobile.

    JavaScript: Handles the form validation process, checking the format and values of user input before submission.

How It Works

1. HTML Structure

    The index.html file contains the basic structure of the page, which includes a form with input fields for credit card information.

    It uses semantic HTML tags to ensure good accessibility and readability for users and search engines.

    Inside the form, each field is clearly labeled, and there are placeholders where users can input their data.

2. CSS Styling

    The styles.css file is used to create a visually appealing layout.

    The page is styled with modern UI components and has a clean, user-friendly interface.

    The CSS makes sure that the page adjusts to different screen sizes, offering a responsive design that looks great on mobile devices as well.

3. JavaScript Validation

    The script.js file contains JavaScript code that performs the following validations:

        Checks for valid credit card number formats.

        Ensures that the expiration date is a future date.

        Validates the CVV field to ensure it contains three digits.

        Displays real-time error messages next to the fields if invalid data is entered.

    The form prevents submission until all fields are correctly filled out and validated.

    When the user submits the form, a simple success message is shown, simulating the payment process.
